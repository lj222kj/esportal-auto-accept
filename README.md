Dumb auto accepting match queue pop chrome extension
## - Auto accept matches when the queue pops on [esportal.com](https://esportal.com/)

I'm lazy and sometimes need some time to get to my PC, hence this extension allows you to specify a waiting period before it accepts the queue pop.

It's simplistic AF but works.
